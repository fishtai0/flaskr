# Flaskr

Yet another [Flasky](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flasky) app built with
Flask + Peewee. Flasky is the companion app to O'Reilly book
[Flask Web Development](http://flaskbook.com/).

**Caution: Don't use this app in production!**

## Variances

- Migrate from [Flask-Script](https://github.com/smurfix/flask-script) to the new Flask cli
- Replace [Flask-SQLAlchemy](http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/) with [Flask-PW](https://github.com/klen/flask-pw)
- Use Github style Identicon to supply user avatars
- Few other minor changes
